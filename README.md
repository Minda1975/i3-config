# i3-config
My personal i3 window manager configuration files, plus other useful stuff.

What is i3? 
i3 It is a dynamic window manager that is targeted at advanced users and developers. It uses clean and documented code in order to allow for ease of configuration. i3 has plain-text configuration, meaning that no lua or haskell is needed. This makes it rather easy to recommend i3 to other people without worrying whether or not they have the knowledge to configure it as it can be read by anyone without prior knowledge.
So I decided to create a separate repo, because i like i3.

i3 configuration is in .config/i3/config. This includes things like key bindings, colorsetc.  Thought has been put into the colors, key bindings and supplementary scripts to make life easier.

i3status confoguration is in .config/i3status/i3status.conf. As status, i use [py3status](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status). It is an extensible i3status wrapper writen in python. I use these modules: clock, loadavg, uptime, weather yahoo and mpd status. For manual how to use these modules, please check great [documentation](https://py3status.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

All this good is working in Debian Unstable (Sid).
